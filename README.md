> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tools has the option to now use the JoyCaption model for captioning images. You will need to have huggingface hub

>```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention.git
> cd flash-attention
> pip install flash_attn --no-build-isolation
> pip install timm
>```
> Install via pipx
> ```bash
> pipx inject ecko-cli flash_attn
> pipx inject ecko-cli timm
>```
> Install via the CLI
> ```bash
> ecko tools install-flash-attention
>```

> [!NOTE]

## Overview

**ecko-cli** is a simple CLI tool that streamlines the process of processingimages in a directory, generating captions, and saving them as text files.
Additionally, it provides functionalities to create a JSONL file from images in the directory you specify. Images will be captioned using the MiaoshouAI/Florence-2-base-PromptGen-v2.0 model. Images are resized to multiple sizes for better captioning results. [1024, 768, 672, 512].

## Why

I wanted to create a tool that would allow me to process images in bulk quickly and efficiently for using in generative art projects. This tool
allows me to generate captions for images that I can use as training data captions for my training LORAs (Large OpenAI Research Agents) and other
generative models.


## Installation (Recommended)

You have a couple of options for installing/running the tool:

### Install [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/installation/), then run the tool with the following command

```bash
pipx install ecko-cli
```

### Alternatively, you can install using `pip`

```bash
pip install .
```

## Configuration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before using the tool, It's required to set up a `.env` file in the parent directory of the script or your home user dir [windows] or `$HOME/.config/ecko-cli-itsjustregi/.env`

The application intelligently locates your `.env` file, accommodating various platforms like Windows and Linux, or defaulting to the current directory.

## Usage // Available Commands

Once installed via pipx or pip:

```
ecko process-images /path/to/images watercolors --padding 4
```
```
ecko process-images --use_joy_cap /path/to/images watercolors --padding 4
```
```
ecko process-images /path/to/images doors --is_object True
```
```
ecko process-images /path/to/images doors --trigger WORD
```
```
ecko create-jsonl /path/to/images [dataset]
```
```
ecko ui /path/to/images
```
